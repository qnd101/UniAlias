The `cjk_brackets` dataset includes 18 unicode bracket characters used in Chinise, Japanese, and Korean writing systems.
Especially, it covers corner brackets (「 」 and 『 』), which are used often in CJK texts, but do not have any western counterpart. 

### Ones with Latex Counterpart
These characters have a similar character in Latex, which is where their aliases derive from.  
(ex) 〈 (`langle_cjk`) has a similar Latex operator ⟨ (`\langle`)
- 〈 (`langle_cjk`) 
- 〉 (`rangle_cjk`) 
- 《 (`lAngle_cjk`) 
- 》 (`rAngle_cjk`) 
- 〚 (`lBrack_cjk`) 
- 〛 (`rBrack_cjk`) 

### Others
Those without any Latex counterpart are given aliases based on their unicode names. 
(ex) 〔 is called `LEFT TORTOISE SHELL BRACKET`, thus given the alias `ltortoise`
- 「 (`lcorner`)  
- 」 (`rcorner`)  
- 『 (`lwhtcorner`)  
- 』 (`rwhtcorner`)  
- 【 (`lblklenticular`)  
- 】 (`rblklenticular`)  
- 〖 (`lwhtlenticular`)  
- 〗 (`rwhtlenticular`)  
- 〔 (`ltortoise`)  
- 〕 (`rtortoise`)  
- 〘 (`lwhttortoise`)
