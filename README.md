# UniAlias
Quickly insert Unicode characters anywhere by typing simple aliases!

## File Structure
File structure is typical of a Tauri project, with an additional `dataset` folder.

- `src-tauri` contains the backend Rust project.
- `frontend` contains a vanilla Vite project.
- `dataset` contains data for alias-to-unicode mapping. For more info, refer to the documentation inside.

## Usage
1) Type the alias in the textbox. Navigate through autocompletions using `Tab`, `Up`, and `Down`. 
2) Select a completion with `Enter`. This will close the window and simulate an insert of the corresponding Unicode character. Press `Esc` to close the window without selecting a completion. 
3) The program continues to run in the background after the window is gone. You can reopen it by clicking the icon in the system tray, or by using the hotkey `Shift+Alt+U`
4) If you want to stop the program, first right-click the icon inside the system tray. This will show the menu strip with `Exit`.

## Datasets
The program reads the alias data from the appdata folder. Specifically, it reads all csv files under
```<appdata>/com.qnd101.unialias.app/dataset/```

In Windows, `<appdata> = $env:APPDATA`. If you are using a different OS, search which folder tauri uses to store application data.

#### Formatting
Each line in the .csv file should look like:
`<alias>,<unicode>`
(ex. `alpha,Î±`)

Note that,
- `<alias>` should consist only of ASCII characters, excluding whitespace. 
- `<unicode>` should be a single UTF-8 character.
- You may put comment lines starting with `#`. They are ignored when parsing.
- Excess spacing doesn't matter. (mostly)

## Setup
```bash
git clone https://github.com/qnd101/UniAlias
cd UniAlias
npm install
```

#### Debug
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
#### Build
```bash
npm run tauri build
```
This will create executable files under `src-tauri/target/release`
